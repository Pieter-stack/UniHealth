<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project

![image1][image1]

### Project Description
This app is designed and developed for university students when they are struggling to stay healthy, throughout each stressful term.

The app features a simple onboarding process to showcase the key points to stay healthy as a student, while still being able to get through a term. The app has faceId and fingerprint security to only allow the owner of the data to view it, making it even more secure and easy system for the students.

Being able to view 5 major health tracking features like, calories burned, walking/running distance for when you are late for class , Uni Health keeps track of everything that will help students stay healthy , telling the sitting and standing time of a student helps them see that they need to take breaks from the computer and walk around.

UniHealth tracks weekly progress and with the widget right on the homescreen the user can quickly view their stats to not waste time with their busy schedules.

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the backend of the application.

### Implementation Process

#### Design Architecture
`SwiftUI` to design the pages used in UniHealth.

#### Highlights

* One highlight was to `explore` being a student and make an app to help me track my health stats.
* `HealthKit` was simple and esay to implement and there are so much more to be explored.
* I loved creating new interfaces where I created a `widget` for this project.

#### Challenges

* I struggled with implementing HealthKit into the widget.

### Reviews and Testing
The `Reviews and Testing` consists of `in class`, reviews.

#### Future Implementation

* Add `More` health stats for the user.
* Have the user select and deselect the health stats he/she wants to track.
* Improve the `widget`.
